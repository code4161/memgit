# memgit — git for AI memory

**Your AI assistants forget everything when the session ends. memgit fixes that.**

Version-controlled, cross-AI context that persists, diffs, rolls back, and syncs like code. Switch from Claude to Cursor to ChatGPT mid-project — your context is already there.

## Why not claude.md? Why not mem-search?

You've probably already tried both. Here's why they hit a ceiling:

| Capability | claude.md | mem-search plugin | **memgit** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Loads only relevant context | ❌ loads everything | ⚠️ loads recent observations | ✅ BM25 search — top-k per query |
| Project-aware across a multi-repo life | ❌ per-file | ❌ | ✅ memories carry a `project`; the current workspace ranks first |
| Adopt on an existing codebase | ❌ starts blank | ❌ starts blank | ✅ `memgit onboard` — seed the store from the repo in one pass |
| Version history | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ full commit log |
| Diff between sessions | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ `memgit diff` |
| Roll back a wrong memory | ❌ manual edit | ❌ | ✅ `memgit rollback` |
| Works in Cursor, Windsurf, GPT | ❌ Claude only | ❌ Claude only | ✅ all via MCP / HTTP |
| Team sync | ❌ copy-paste files | ❌ | ✅ `memgit git push` |
| Scales to 10k+ sessions | ❌ file grows | ❌ search slows | ✅ `memgit squash` |
| Measurable token savings | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ `memgit stats` |
| Export / import standard format | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ TOON + git |

---

## Proof — token savings you can measure

Run this on your own store to see the actual numbers:

```
$ memgit stats

  Total memories:   108   (41 feedback · 23 user · 19 project · 12 reference · 8 convention · 5 lesson)
  Priority:          3 critical · 67 medium · 38 low

  Token cost comparison:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┬──────────────────┬───────────────────┬─────────────────────┐
  │ Approach                            │ Tokens/session   │ vs full load      │ $/session (GPT-4o)  │
  ├─────────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────┼───────────────────┼─────────────────────┤
  │ claude.md / dump all memories       │ 12,840           │ 100%  baseline    │ $0.0321             │
  │ memgit search (BM25 top-8)          │ 640              │ 5%  (95% savings) │ $0.0016             │
  └─────────────────────────────────────┴──────────────────┴───────────────────┴─────────────────────┘

  Weekly savings (10 sessions/week):
    Tokens saved:   122,000/week
    Cost saved:     $0.31/week  →  $15.86/year  (at GPT-4o input pricing, $2.50/M)
```

**Why such a big difference?** claude.md loads *all* context every session. memgit uses BM25 relevance scoring — it loads *only the 8 memories most relevant to the current session*, not everything you've ever recorded.

---

## The git analogy is literal

memgit's data model maps exactly to git:

| memgit | git |
|---|---|
| `mnemonic` | file |
| `MindState` | tree |
| `checkpoint` | commit |
| `thread` | branch |
| `memgit commit` | `git commit` |
| `memgit diff` | `git diff` |
| `memgit log` | `git log` |
| `memgit squash --keep-last 100` | `git rebase -i --autosquash` |
| `memgit git push` | `git push` |

This is not metaphorical — memgit uses a **content-addressed object store** (SHA-256 blobs) identical to git's architecture. Every memory has a stable SHA. Identical content has identical SHAs. Old state is always recoverable.

---

## The store IS a git repo

Every memory is a readable `.toon` file under `memories/`. Push your entire memory set to GitHub with standard git:

```bash
memgit git init --remote git@github.com:yourteam/ai-memory.git
memgit git push
```

Teammates pull and start with your AI's learned rules from session 1:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:yourteam/ai-memory.git ~/.claude/memgit-store
memgit setup all
```

You can `grep`, `git blame`, and `git diff` your memories just like code:

```bash
grep -rl "database" ~/.claude/memgit-store/memories/
git log --follow memories/no-db-mock.toon
git diff HEAD~7 memories/
```

---

## Install

**Mac / Linux:**
```bash
pip install memgit
```

**Mac (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew tap code4161/tap && brew install memgit
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
pip install memgit
```
(`choco install memgit` is not live yet — the Chocolatey package is not on community.chocolatey.org. Use pip until it lands.)

**Any AI tool config (no Python needed — npx auto-installs on first run):**
```json
{ "mcpServers": { "memgit": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "memgit-mcp"] } } }
```

---

## Quickstart (3 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Install and initialize
pip install memgit
memgit init               # auto-detects the best location, finds your existing
                          # Claude Code memories, and offers to import them

# 2. Register with your AI tools (interactive picker)
memgit setup

# 3. See your token savings
memgit stats
```

`init` walks you through it — no paths to hunt down. (Importing later is one command with no arguments: `memgit sync` auto-finds `~/.claude/projects/*/memory`.)

Restart your AI tool — it now searches your memory store at the start of every session.

---

## Adopting memgit mid-project

Memory tools have a cold-start problem: install one halfway through a project and it knows *nothing* — there's no initial point, and context only trickles in from future sessions. memgit solves this with a one-time seeding pass:

```bash
cd your-project
memgit onboard          # mines the repo, prints the bootstrap brief
```

`onboard` first extracts a **repo digest** deterministically — git history (recent commit subjects, hot files/directories by churn, authors, branch, tags), detected stack from manifests, and the docs worth reading — using bounded, read-only probes that stay near-instant even on huge repositories. The brief then tells your AI agent exactly what to do with it: read only the listed files (no tree crawling), extract 10–20 durable facts (purpose, architecture, conventions, current state, gotchas), save each as a typed memory, and checkpoint the seed set. Paste it into a session — or don't: if the AI searches memory in a project that has none, the MCP server itself replies with the bootstrap instructions instead of a bare "no results."

Memories are **project-scoped**: each carries the workspace it belongs to, searches boost the project you're standing in (global rules still surface), and the resume digest leads with *your current project's* recent work — not whatever repo you touched last night.

---

## Resume where you left off

Ask an AI "can we proceed on the pending tasks?" in a fresh session and it will guess from whatever file happens to be open. `memgit resume` replaces the guess with the record:

```bash
memgit resume            # last checkpoints, work in flight, recent + critical memories
memgit resume --plain    # plain text, for piping into an AI context
memgit resume --json     # for tooling
```

Wire it into Claude Code so memory becomes **automatic** — no tool call, no judgment required:

```bash
memgit setup hooks       # installs all four hooks (~/.claude/settings.json)
```

| Hook | What it enforces |
|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | every session opens with the resume digest in context |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | each prompt is BM25-matched against the store; relevant memories are injected (silent when nothing clears the relevance bar; never repeats within a session) — `--no-recall` to skip |
| `Stop` (guard) | a session that did real work but saved nothing gets ONE nudge to save durable facts before finishing — `--no-guard` to skip |
| `Stop` (sync) | markdown memories are checkpointed asynchronously at session end |

Why hooks and not just good tool descriptions? We measured it: across 166 real sessions, hook-injected context was delivered in **100%** of them while voluntary memory-tool calls happened in **6%**. What a hook enforces happens.

The resume digest is deliberately bounded (~350 tokens measured on a 500-memory store): rules are clipped, the critical list is capped, and full text is one `get_memory` call away.

---

## Scale to 10,000+ sessions

After months of use, your checkpoint history grows. Squash compresses it, gc reclaims the disk:

```bash
memgit squash --keep-last 100    # keep last 100 checkpoints, squash everything older
memgit squash --older-than 30    # squash everything older than 30 days
memgit squash --dry-run          # preview first

memgit gc                        # delete unreachable objects, trim reflogs
memgit gc --dry-run              # preview
memgit gc --squash-keep 200      # compact history, then sweep
```

The current memory **state is always preserved** — and squash is lossless-in-substance: every collapsed checkpoint leaves a one-line record (time, author, diff, message) in an append-only archive under `.memgit/logs/archive/` that gc never touches. Benchmark on a 2,000-checkpoint store: **94% smaller** (39.5 MB → 2.2 MB), `fsck` clean. History operations stay O(1) as the chain grows (SHA resolution and checkpoint counting measured at ~0.08 ms at 2,000 checkpoints).

---

## Multiple agents, one memory

All writes go through a git-style store lock (0.08 ms overhead), so concurrent agents can't corrupt the store or lose each other's updates. Two patterns:

**Shared thread** — agents write concurrently; if one commits while another has work staged, the second commit auto-merges (three-way, against the recorded base) instead of clobbering. Set `MEMGIT_AUTHOR=agent-name` so each checkpoint says who did it.

**Thread per agent** — isolate, then integrate:

```bash
memgit thread create agent-1     # branch off for each agent
# ... agents work on their own threads ...
memgit merge agent-1             # three-way merge back (common-ancestor based)
```

Conflicts (same memory changed on both sides) resolve to the newest version; an edit always beats a delete. Both histories are preserved.

---

## What the AI sees

Once registered via MCP, every AI tool gets 6 tools:

| Tool | When the AI uses it |
|---|---|
| `resume_session` | When the request depends on prior state — "continue", "the pending tasks", session start |
| `search_memories` | Before answering anything that touches past work or preferences |
| `get_memory` | When it needs full details of a specific memory |
| `list_memories` | To browse or audit what's stored |
| `save_memory` | When it learns something worth keeping for next time |
| `get_checkpoint_log` | To check when memories were last synced |

The tool descriptions teach the AI **judgment** — "does this request depend on state you don't have in context?" — rather than keyword triggers. Measured cost of the whole tool surface: ~1,150 tokens once per session; a `resume_session` reply is ~335.

## TOON format — compact, readable, diffable

Standard markdown memory file:
```markdown
## Rule: Never mock the database in tests
**Type:** feedback  
**Priority:** medium  
**Why:** We got burned last quarter — mocked tests passed but the prod migration failed.  
**When to apply:** Any time writing tests that touch persistence layers.  
**Tags:** testing, database
```

The same memory in TOON:
```
TOON1|fb|no-db-mock|2026-07-01T10:00Z
#testing #database
PROJ:my-app
RULE:Never mock the database in tests
WHY:Mocked tests passed but prod migration failed last quarter
WHEN:Any persistence test
BODY:Full long-form detail lives here, losslessly (newlines escaped).\nSearch returns the compact RULE; get_memory returns everything.
```

Measured with a real tokenizer, TOON is ~5–10% leaner than equivalent markdown — a nice bonus, not the headline. **The headline saving is retrieval**: memgit loads the top-8 relevant memories per query instead of everything.

At 108 memories: **12,840 tokens (dump everything) → 640 tokens (memgit BM25 top-8)**

For exact token counts in `memgit stats`, install the optional tokenizer: `pip install "memgit[tokens]"`.

~/.claude/memgit-store/
  .memgit/
    objects/     ← SHA-256 content-addressed blobs (gzip compressed)
    refs/threads/main   ← HEAD checkpoint SHA
    TOON_INDEX   ← active slug→sha mapping
    config       ← author, default thread
    logs/        ← ref change audit trail
  memories/      ← flat .toon files (git-trackable, human-readable)
  .git/          ← standard git repo (after `memgit git init`)
